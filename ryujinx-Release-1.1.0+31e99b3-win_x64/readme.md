This is the version `ryujinx-Release-1.1.0+31e99b3-win_x64` I compiled myself on Windows 11 and tested it without problems, but this only applies to me, I did not test it on other computers, if you have problems running it on your computer, you may need to compile it yourself.
To avoid putting it on another platform and not being able to download it, I put it directly on GitHub. However, due to GitHub's limitations, each file has a maximum size of 25MB, so I cut it into multiple zip packages, and you need to download both of them in full to unzip them.
